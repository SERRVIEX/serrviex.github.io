                    <h2>Our Commitment to Children's Safety</h2>
                    <p>At Ciornii Sergiu, we develop various mobile applications. This Children's Safety Policy applies specifically to our <strong>family safety Apps</strong> when children participate in family groups.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Our general-purpose Apps (games, utilities) are designed for users aged 13 and older and are not intended for children under 13.</p>
                    <p>Our family safety Apps are designed for families of all compositions. Families may include only adults, or may include children. <strong>For families consisting entirely of adult members (18+), the child-specific restrictions described in this policy do not apply.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>When children participate in our family safety Apps, we implement additional safeguards to protect their privacy and safety, as described below.</strong></p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Applicable Laws and Compliance</h2>
                    <p>We comply with children's privacy laws worldwide, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act):</strong> United States federal law protecting children under 13</li>
                        <li><strong>GDPR-K (General Data Protection Regulation - Children):</strong> European Union regulations requiring parental consent for children under 16 (or lower age set by member states, minimum 13)</li>
                        <li><strong>AADC (Age Appropriate Design Code):</strong> UK children's code requiring privacy by default for children</li>
                        <li><strong>LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados):</strong> Brazilian data protection law with specific provisions for children</li>
                        <li><strong>POPIA (Protection of Personal Information Act):</strong> South African regulations for processing children's data</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We follow the strictest applicable standards to ensure all children using our Apps receive the highest level of protection, regardless of their location.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Family Safety Apps</h2>
                    <p>Our family safety Apps enable families to stay connected and ensure everyone's safety. These Apps support features like family location sharing, safety alerts, and family communication.</p>
                    <p><strong>Adult-Only Families:</strong> Families may consist entirely of adult members (18+). In this case, no child-specific restrictions apply and all features are available.</p>
                    <p><strong>Families with Children:</strong> When children participate in family groups, they do so under the supervision and control of adult family members, with the protections described below.</p>

                    <h3>How Family Apps Work</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Adult-Created Groups:</strong> Only adults (18+) can create family groups</li>
                        <li><strong>Parental Control:</strong> When children participate, parents maintain full control over their participation, including the ability to view, modify, and delete all data</li>
                        <li><strong>Closed Family Groups:</strong> All members can only interact with verified family members within their family group - no strangers can contact them</li>
                        <li><strong>Location Sharing:</strong> Location is only visible to family members within the group</li>
                        <li><strong>No Public Features:</strong> There are no public profiles or ability to connect with unknown users</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Age Requirements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Creating Family Groups:</strong> Must be 18 or older to create a family group</li>
                        <li><strong>Account Creation:</strong> All users create their own accounts. During registration, users must provide their age or birthdate for age verification</li>
                        <li><strong>Children Under 13:</strong> May create accounts and join family groups only with verifiable parental consent. Have access to limited app functionality with certain features requiring parental verification</li>
                        <li><strong>Teens 13-17:</strong> May create accounts and join family groups with parental approval; consent requirements vary by jurisdiction</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Parental Consent Process</h2>
                    <p>The following consent process applies only when a family includes members under 13 years old. Before a child under 13 can participate in our family Apps, we require parental consent. Our consent process works as follows:</p>

                    <h3>How Parental Consent Works</h3>
                    <ol style="list-style: decimal; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Age Verification:</strong> During account creation, users must enter their birthdate. If the user is under 13, the app requires parental involvement to proceed</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Parent Adds Child:</strong> Only a parent or guardian (18+) who has created a family group can add a child to that group</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Parent Email Verification:</strong> The parent provides their email address and must verify it by clicking a confirmation link</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Consent Confirmation:</strong> The parent must actively confirm that they consent to their child's participation and data collection by reviewing and accepting this policy</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>What Parents Are Informed About</h3>
                    <p>Before providing consent, parents are informed about:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What information we collect from their child (location, account info, messages within the family group)</li>
                        <li>How we use the information (solely for family safety features)</li>
                        <li>That they can review, modify, or delete their child's data at any time</li>
                        <li>That they can remove their child from the family group at any time</li>
                        <li>How to contact us with questions or concerns</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Parental Rights</h3>
                    <p>Parents maintain full control and can at any time:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>View all data collected about their child</li>
                        <li>Modify their child's profile and settings</li>
                        <li>Delete their child's account and all associated data</li>
                        <li>Remove their child from the family group</li>
                        <li>Withdraw consent for data collection</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                    <h2>Information We Collect from Children</h2>
                    <p>We follow the principle of data minimization for children, meaning we only collect information that is strictly necessary to provide the requested service.</p>

                        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Real-time GPS location to enable family members to see each other's whereabouts (with verifiable parental consent for children under 13)</li>
                        <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Chat messages sent within family groups (children under 13 have limited content creation abilities and certain actions require parental verification)</li>
                        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, operating system, and app version (for app functionality and troubleshooting)</li>
                        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Basic app usage to provide and improve the service (never for advertising targeting)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Information We Do NOT Collect from Children</h3>

                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>How We Use Children's Information</h2>
                    <p>When children participate in our family Apps, their information is used only for purposes that directly support the family safety functionality:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Providing Family Safety Features:</strong> Enabling family location sharing and safety alerts</li>
                        <li><strong>Family Chat:</strong> Children can send and receive messages with family members within their family group</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Content Creation:</strong> Children under 13 can view content created by other family members but have limited ability to create their own content. Certain actions require parental verification</li>
                        <li><strong>Family Group Participation:</strong> Maintaining the child's participation within the family group</li>
                        <li><strong>Safety and Security:</strong> Protecting the child from unauthorized access and ensuring app security</li>
                        <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> Responding to parent or guardian inquiries</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Complying with legal requirements and responding to valid legal requests</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><strong>No Behavioral Advertising:</strong> We do not use children's information for targeted or behavioral advertising</li>
                        <li><strong>No Profiling:</strong> We do not create behavioral or interest-based profiles of children</li>
                        <li><strong>No Sale of Children's Data:</strong> We do not sell, rent, or trade personal information collected from children</li>
                        <li><strong>No Third-Party Marketing:</strong> We do not share children's information with third parties for their marketing purposes</li>
                    </ul>

                <section>
                    <h2>Advertising and Children</h2>
                    <p>We take a strict approach to advertising when it comes to children:</p>

                    <h3>No Advertising for Users Under 13</h3>
                    <p><strong>Users identified as children under 13 do not see any advertisements.</strong> We do not display ads to children under 13 in our family Apps.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Ads Displayed:</strong> Children under 13 do not see any advertisements in our Apps</li>
                        <li><strong>No Advertising ID Collection:</strong> We do not collect or transmit advertising identifiers (IDFA, GAID) from users identified as children under 13</li>
                        <li><strong>No Behavioral Tracking:</strong> We do not track or profile users identified as children for any advertising purposes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Advertising for Adult Users</h3>
                    <p>Adult users (parents and guardians who are 18+) may see advertisements based on their interests and usage, subject to their consent and privacy settings. Adults can opt out of personalized advertising through their device settings.</p>

                    <h3>General Advertising Standards</h3>
                    <p>All advertising shown to adult users in our Apps must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be clearly distinguishable from app content</li>
                        <li>Not use deceptive or manipulative practices</li>
                        <li>Comply with applicable advertising laws and platform policies</li>
                        <li>Not promote products inappropriate for family contexts (gambling, adult content, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
                    <p>Our Apps may offer premium features, subscriptions, or in-app purchases. Purchases are handled through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, which have their own age-appropriate purchase policies.</p>
                    <p><strong>Adult-Only Families:</strong> For families consisting entirely of adult members, there are no age-based purchase restrictions within our Apps.</p>

                    <h3>Purchase Policies by Age (When Children Participate)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Children Under 13:</strong> Cannot make in-app purchases. Purchase functionality is disabled for users identified as under 13 based on their birthdate during account creation</li>
                        <li><strong>Teens 13-17:</strong> May make purchases subject to device parental control settings and platform policies</li>
                        <li><strong>Adults 18+:</strong> May make purchases without restrictions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Device-Level Purchase Protections</h3>
                    <p>Apple and Google provide device-level purchase protections that parents can configure on their children's devices:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Apple:</strong> Screen Time and Family Sharing allow parents to require "Ask to Buy" approval for all purchases</li>
                        <li><strong>Google:</strong> Family Link allows parents to approve or block app downloads and in-app purchases</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We recommend parents configure these settings on their children's devices for additional protection.</p>

                    <h3>Parental Responsibility</h3>
                    <p>Parents are responsible for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Managing their children's participation within our family Apps</li>
                        <li>Monitoring their children's purchases and app usage</li>
                        <li>Optionally configuring device-level parental controls (Screen Time, Family Link) for additional protection</li>
                        <li>Any purchases made by their children</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Data Security for Children</h2>
                    <p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect children's information. Our Apps use Google Firebase for backend services, which provides enterprise-grade security:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> All data transmitted between the App and our servers is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security)</li>
                        <li><strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> Data stored in Firebase (Firestore, Storage) is automatically encrypted at rest using Google's encryption standards</li>
                        <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Firebase security rules restrict data access to authorized users only (e.g., family members can only access their own family's data)</li>
                        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Secure user authentication through Firebase Authentication</li>
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure Security:</strong> Firebase runs on Google Cloud Platform, which maintains SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3, and ISO 27001 certifications</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For more information about Firebase security practices, see <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy and Security</a>.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Data Retention for Children</h2>
                    <p>We maintain a written data retention policy. We retain children's information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Active Accounts:</strong> Data is retained while the child's account remains active within a family group</li>
                        <li><strong>Location History:</strong> Location data is retained for up to 10 days for family safety features, then automatically deleted</li>
                        <li><strong>Chat Messages:</strong> Family chat messages are retained for up to 30 days, then automatically deleted</li>
                        <li><strong>Removal from Family Group:</strong> When a parent removes a child from a family group, the child's association with that group is removed immediately</li>
                        <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> Each user is responsible for deleting their own account. When a user deletes their account, we delete their personal information within 30 days</li>
                        <li><strong>Inactive Accounts:</strong> Accounts inactive for 12 months are automatically deleted</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Some data may be retained longer if required by law (e.g., for legal proceedings)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We delete children's data once it is no longer necessary to provide the service for which it was collected. We do not retain children's data indefinitely.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Cookies and Persistent Identifiers</h2>
                    <p>We take a strict approach to tracking technologies for children:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Marketing Cookies:</strong> We do not use marketing, advertising, or tracking cookies for children under 13</li>
                        <li><strong>No Advertising Identifiers:</strong> We do not collect IDFA, GAID, or similar advertising identifiers from children's devices</li>
                        <li><strong>Essential Identifiers Only:</strong> We may use strictly necessary identifiers (such as authentication tokens) to keep children logged in and provide the service</li>
                        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> For children under 13, we disable personalized analytics and do not track user behavior for profiling purposes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Fair Design Practices</h2>
                    <p>We are committed to fair design practices that protect children:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Dark Patterns:</strong> We do not use deceptive design, manipulative language, or "dark patterns" to trick children into sharing more information or making purchases</li>
                        <li><strong>No Urgency Tactics:</strong> We do not use countdown timers, scarcity messaging, or pressure tactics that could manipulate children</li>
                        <li><strong>Clear Language:</strong> All prompts and consent requests use simple, age-appropriate language</li>
                        <li><strong>Easy Opt-Out:</strong> It is as easy to decline data collection as it is to accept</li>
                        <li><strong>Privacy by Default:</strong> Children's privacy settings are set to the most protective levels by default</li>
                    </ul>

                <section>
                    <h2>Parental Rights and Controls</h2>
                    <p>Parents and legal guardians have comprehensive rights regarding their children's information and account:</p>

                    <h3>Your Rights as a Parent</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Right to Review:</strong> Request and receive a copy of all personal information we have collected from your child</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> Request deletion of your child's personal information at any time</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Refuse:</strong> Refuse to permit any further collection or use of your child's information</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> Withdraw your consent at any time, which will result in deletion of your child's account and data</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Correct:</strong> Request correction of any inaccurate information about your child</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Limit:</strong> Limit or restrict how your child's information is used</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Parent Controls</h3>
                    <p>Parents can manage family group membership from their own device:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Family Member Management:</strong> Add or remove children from the family group</li>
                        <li><strong>Consent Management:</strong> Grant or withdraw consent for a child's participation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Child's Device Settings</h3>
                    <p>Each user controls their own app settings on their own device. When a child sets up the app, they must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Grant Location Access:</strong> Allow the app to access their device's GPS for location sharing</li>
                        <li><strong>Enable Notifications:</strong> Allow notifications to receive alerts from family members</li>
                        <li><strong>Set Up Their Profile:</strong> Enter their name/nickname and other profile information</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Parents should assist their children with these settings during initial setup. The child's device permissions are controlled by the device's operating system settings, not by the parent's app.</p>

                    <h3>How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>
                    <p>To exercise any parental rights, you can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use the app to add or remove your child from the family group</li>
                        <li>Email us at <a href="mailto:sergiu1203@proton.me">sergiu1203@proton.me</a> with "Children's Privacy Request" in the subject line</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>We will verify your identity as the child's parent before processing any request. We will respond within 30 days (or sooner if required by applicable law).</p>
