                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                    <p>We take children's privacy seriously. For detailed information about how we protect children in family-oriented Apps, please see our <a href="children-safety.html">Children's Safety Policy</a>.</p>

                    <h3>General Apps</h3>
                    <p>Our general-purpose Apps (games, utilities) are not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 in these Apps. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

                    <h3>Family Safety Apps</h3>
                    <p>Some of our Apps are family safety applications that enable families to share locations and stay connected. These Apps support families of all compositions - including families consisting entirely of adults, as well as families that include children. For families with only adult members (18+), standard privacy practices apply with no age-based restrictions.</p>
                    <p>When children participate in family groups, additional safeguards apply as described below.</p>

                    <h4>Information We Collect When Children Participate</h4>
                    <p>All users, including children, create their own accounts. During registration, users provide their age or birthdate for age verification purposes. When a child (under 13) creates an account and joins a family group (with parental consent), we collect the following information:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Name or nickname, email address (for login), age/birthdate (for verification), profile picture (optional)</li>
                        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Children may sign in using email, Sign in with Google, or Sign in with Apple</li>
                        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Real-time GPS location to enable family location sharing features</li>
                        <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Chat messages sent within family groups (children under 13 have limited content creation abilities)</li>
                        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, operating system, and app version (for functionality and troubleshooting)</li>
                        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> App usage information to provide and improve the service</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This information is collected solely to provide the family safety features and is not used for advertising purposes. Children can chat with family members and view content created by other family members. Children under 13 have access to limited app functionality and certain features require parental verification to use. All interactions are limited to their family group - they cannot interact with anyone outside the group.</p>

                    <h4>How We Protect Children's Data</h4>
                    <p>The following protections apply when a family includes children under 13:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Age Verification:</strong> All users provide their age or birthdate during account creation to verify eligibility</li>
                        <li><strong>Adult-Created Groups:</strong> Only adults (18+) can create family groups</li>
                        <li><strong>Parental Consent:</strong> Parents must verify their email and actively consent before a child under 13 can participate</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Functionality:</strong> Children under 13 have access to limited app features and certain actions require parental verification</li>
                        <li><strong>Parent-Controlled:</strong> Parents maintain full control over their children's data and can view, modify, or delete it at any time</li>
